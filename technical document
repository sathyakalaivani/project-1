<h1>About: </h1>
<p >fashion store is an online shopping platform owned by the Indian company Fashnear Technologies Private Limited. It is an online marketplace that facilitates trade between suppliers, resellers and customers, with heavy reliance of external social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram</p>
<h3>Scale and sustainability</h3>
<p>These guidelines are observations and learnings from our journey. We started with a monolith. Hacked our way to ship fast, rewrote and re-architected most of our systems to handle current and future scale.
<br><br>
We use the best toolsets to solve a problem. We don't believe in running after the newest shiny toy in the world of tech. As such, these fads occur every 3 months - and not participating in one, is also a collective will of how we look at tech tooling.<br><br>
All tech has to solve a problem statement. Itâ€™s easy to get swept up in the euphoria around new technologies. We believe in looking at problem statements, rather than solutions searching for a problem.
